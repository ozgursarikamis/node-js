So far in this post all of my examples involve the use of the data event. This event is not just an event of fs.createReadStream, but of read streams in general. In any case this event is by far the most important event of a readable stream because in any application that involves the use of a readable stream I will want to do something with that data as it comes in chunk, by chunk.
